The program focuses on student-centered learning:        Student-centered learning is an effective educational approach that shifts the focus from       traditional, teacher-led instruction to a more personalized and interactive learning experience.       By actively engaging students, fostering collaboration, and encouraging self-directed learning,       this method helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and learning skills.            The program provides Hands-on approach to learning:         Hands-on approach will be involved in practical work to be skilled practitioners, Through activities       like clinical rotations, simulations, and skills labs, medical students gain real-world experience that        enhances their understanding of medical concepts, procedures, and patient interactions.             The program provides great educational experiences that include problem-based        learning, case-based learning, collaborative study groups and self-directed learning:          Problem-Based Learning (PBL): is an active learning method that focuses on using real-world       problems as a context for students to develop problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration       skills. In PBL, students are presented with complex, open-ended problems that don’t have a single       correct answer. They work in groups to research, discuss, and develop solutions, integrating       knowledge from multiple disciplines.        Case-Based Learning (CBL): is an instructional strategy where students learn by analyzing and       discussing real or simulated cases that reflect complex, real-world situations. In this approach,       students are provided with detailed scenarios or case studies that mimic practical challenges they       will encounter in their professional fields.         Collaborative Study Groups: are small, organized groups of students who come together to       learn, discuss, and solve problems collectively. The goal is to enhance understanding through       shared knowledge, different perspectives, and cooperative learning. These groups are       particularly useful in complex subjects, such as medicine, where collaboration and discussion       can lead to deeper insights.        Self-Directed Learning (SDL): is an educational approach where learners take initiative and       responsibility for their own learning process. In this model, students set their own learning       goals, identify resources, and evaluate their progress, with minimal guidance from instructors. It       emphasizes independence, critical thinking, and lifelong learning.           The program is designed to develop student’s professionalism, communication, time        management, ability to work as part of a team, research skills and much more.
